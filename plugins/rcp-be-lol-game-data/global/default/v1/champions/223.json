His lashing tongue can stun even a heavily armored warrior from a dozen paces, and to fall into his rumbling belly is to tumble into an abyss from which there is little hope of return.","tacticalInfo":{"style":7,"difficulty":1,"damageType":"kMagic"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":2,"durability":3,"crowdControl":2,"mobility":1,"utility":3},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/223.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/223.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/223.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/223.ogg","roles":["support","tank"],"recommendedItemDefaults":["/DATA/Characters/TahmKench/Recommended/Beginner.json","/DATA/Characters/TahmKench/Recommended/TahmKenchARAM.json","/DATA/Characters/TahmKench/Recommended/TahmKenchFIRSTBLOOD.json","/DATA/Characters/TahmKench/Recommended/TahmKenchKINGPORO.json","/DATA/Characters/TahmKench/Recommended/TahmKenchNB.json","/DATA/Characters/TahmKench/Recommended/TahmKenchSR.json"],"skins":[{"id":223000,"isBase":true,"name":"Tahm Kench","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/223/223000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/223/223000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/223/223000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/TahmKench/Skins/Base/TahmKenchLoadScreen.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":223001,"isBase":false,"name":"Master Chef Tahm Kench","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/223/223001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/223/223001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/223/223001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/TahmKench/Skins/Skin01/TahmKenchLoadScreen_1.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":26}],"description":"He's the sushi singer, the loquacious pescatarian, the big catfish with a big fish dish.
