This monosyllabic monstrosity seems to want nothing more than pain—both the giving of it, and the receiving of it. Wielding his massive meat cleaver as if it were weightless, Mundo is infamous for capturing and torturing dozens of Zaun's citizens for his nefarious “operations,” which seem to have no overall point or goal. He is brutal. He is unpredictable. He goes where he pleases. He is also not, technically, a doctor.","tacticalInfo":{"style":6,"difficulty":1,"damageType":"kMixed"},"playstyleInfo":{"damage":2,"durability":3,"crowdControl":1,"mobility":1,"utility":1},"squarePortraitPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-icons/36.png","stingerSfxPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-sfx-audios/36.ogg","chooseVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-choose-vo/36.ogg","banVoPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-ban-vo/36.ogg","roles":["fighter","tank"],"recommendedItemDefaults":[],"skins":[{"id":36000,"isBase":true,"name":"Dr. Mundo","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/36/36000.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/36/36000.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/36/36000.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/DrMundo/Skins/Base/DrMundoLoadScreen.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":36001,"isBase":false,"name":"Toxic Dr. Mundo","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/36/36001.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/36/36001.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/36/36001.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/DrMundo/Skins/Skin01/DrMundoLoadScreen_1.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":true,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":36002,"isBase":false,"name":"Mr. Mundoverse","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/36/36002.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/36/36002.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/36/36002.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/DrMundo/Skins/Skin02/DrMundoLoadScreen_2.jpg","loadScreenVintagePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/DrMundo/Skins/Skin02/DrMundoLoadScreen_2_LE.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kNoRarity","isLegacy":true,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":null,"description":null},{"id":36003,"isBase":false,"name":"Corporate Mundo","splashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/36/36003.jpg","uncenteredSplashPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-splashes/uncentered/36/36003.jpg","tilePath":"/lol-game-data/assets/v1/champion-tiles/36/36003.jpg","loadScreenPath":"/lol-game-data/assets/ASSETS/Characters/DrMundo/Skins/Skin03/DrMundoLoadScreen_3.jpg","skinType":"","rarity":"kLegendary","isLegacy":false,"splashVideoPath":null,"collectionSplashVideoPath":null,"featuresText":null,"chromaPath":null,"emblems":null,"regionRarityId":0,"rarityGemPath":null,"skinLines":[{"id":100}],"description":"Mundo's actually planning a large layoff for the company he just acquired, but it doesn't matter.
